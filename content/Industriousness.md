I have a friend who is very into the Myers-Brigg Personality Inventory. She openly talks about 'her type' and suggested I take the inventory myself, which I did, but not after giving her a mouthful about the insubstantiality of the research behind Myers-Briggs (she should have known better than to talk to a neuroscience major about personality psych!).

 The personality test I have the most respect for is the Five Factors personality inventory, which rates one by where they lie on a spectrum of different attributes: Creativity, Openness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness. Unlike the Myers-briggs, this test is well supported by the research; people's personality as measured by this test appears to be fairly consistent throughout the lifespan.

The Five Factors or 'Big Five' model has been a starting point for a lot of research into what personality attributes are important for success. One major study measured the personalities of school children and correlated their placement among the different attributes with academic achievement and career success later in life. Unambiguously, the personality attribute that was most highly correlated with financial and academic success was conscientiousness.

Conscientiousness is a broad term for traits such as discipline, resilience, organization, and responsibility. In the literature, it is often referred to as grit. You might have read things about grit in the media (there was a popular book published on it called "How Children Succeed"). Basically, it is a trait related to the ability to delay reward or withstand discomfort in order to achieve long-term goals. 

Like all of the Big Five, conscientiousness appears to be fairly stable throughout the lifespan. However, there is good news for those of us who might not be top-tier in terms of self-discipline. Conscientiousness does appear to be trainable.

An awesome paper from the 70s reviewed the body of psychology research that studied the trait of industriousness (analagous to conscientiousness), and how its expression is influenced by the environment of reinforcement. 

The typical experiment went like this: rats were trained to work at a task in order to obtain a food reward. Then, the rats were given a seperate task in which they had to exert themselves in a different way to get the reward. In all the different permutations of this experimental design, rats that had to work harder at the first task worked harder and persevered longer at the second task. The theoretical basis behind this effect is that the experience of working hard for a reward makes the process of work itself rewarding, or at least decreases the negative association with the process of work.

This is related to the concept of intermittent reinforcement, which is the most effective training schedule in order to make a behaviour persistent once rewards stop being given. 

Interestingly, similar research was also done on humans. An experiment done on learning disabled children found that students who were rewarded only when they scored well on a reading task went on to produce higher quality school work than students who were rewarded for merely completing the reading task. The research made a big deal out of the fact that the students not only went on to perform better in reading, the task whose reward schedule they had manipulated, but also performance in other aspects of school too. They saw this as evidence that their meritocratic system had trained the students to value the process of putting in work. 

Although a bit antiquated, these studies are interesting and suggest that, in order to be more productive, one needs to learn to tolerate discomfort and be able to delay gratification. It's possible that training this skill directly -- the ability to tolerate, and possibly even enjoy, the discomfort of working hard -- might increase productivity across the board. However, it's not clear that such benefits will persist after training.

Based on the research, here are some key recommendations for training yourself to be more industrious:
1. Reward yourself only for high quality work
2. Expose yourself to the discomfort of hard effort
3. Begin a practice to develop self-control, such as taking cold showers

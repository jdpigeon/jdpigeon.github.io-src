Title: 5 Tips on Completing a PhD

A very wise man on his graduation shared these five lessons with me:

1. Don't piss off your advisor; play the game.

2. Learn patience; experiments will fail.

3. Explore as much as you can while in school. 

4. Try to remember why you liked science before starting a PhD.

5. Learn quantitative methods; the future of biology is not going to be just biology. *Learn to code*  
  
  




He now has the best job in the world building artificial intelligence for Google, so I try to follow these lessons as closely as possible.

This is the stuff you use daily: email, calendar, news, Facebook, etc. In the
past companies like Yahoo! focused on portal sites that fulfilled all these
needs. Now everyone has moved over to a tab driven workflow of specialized
sites.

I'm keyboard driven, so I've solved this problem with [Quickmarks][qm]. Simply,
I type a command `b email` in my address bar to visit my email. In reality, I've
simplified all my common sites to single letter aliases such as `b c` to visit
Google Calendar rather than depend on address bar auto-completion.

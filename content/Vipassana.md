Title: A Neuroscientific Impression of a Vipassana Retreat
Summary: I wish someone had warned me about the chanting. Every meditation begins with Goenka reciting Buddhist scripture in a long, low, loud, crumbly drone that fails to adhere to any standards of tonality. Musically, it is very, very bad.

After escaping University with my diploma in neuroscience, I decided to use some of my newly-earned freedom to study the mind from a different perspective. I had heard from several friends about “hardcore” Vipassana retreats that were available by donation to people who wanted to study meditation and thought I might try one in order to further my own meditation practice. My experience ended up being more intense, transformative, and intellectually interesting than I could have imagined.

### The Vipassana Experience

A Vipassana retreat is a rigorously structured, 10-day, silent meditation course taught entirely by the audio and video recordings of SN Goenka, a businessman-turned-Buddhist teacher who popularized a certain style of Burmese meditation. Each retreat is essentially a crash course in meditation and Buddhist Philosophy, though it sometimes feels like an induction into a jolly Indian ghost's personal army of mind-soldiers.

In a way, a Vipassana retreat is a lot like the summer camp you may have gone to as a kid: you head off into the wilderness, live in gender-specific dorms, eat in a mess hall, and can't leave. The big difference is that the only thing you do at this camp is meditate (about 11 hours a day). There is no talking, no exercising, no meals after noon, just meditation, stretching, drinking tea, walking in the woods, and brushing your teeth. This is quite a radical way to spend one's time and may lead to profound introspection, intense psychological strain, and a whole assortment of weird trance states. For me, it was a fascinating exercise in studying the brain 'from the inside out' and a fruitful opportunity to reappraise habits, strengthen some cognitive abilities, and sort out girl problems. 

When I arrived at the center, I was asked whether I knew what I was getting in to and if I would commit to staying for the whole ten days. The accommodations were nice and the people reassuringly placid, so I consented. Shortly thereafter, all the students gathered in the dining hall -- all different ages, all white, all drinking tea and awaiting the first sitting. The ladies chatted animatedly in their corner, like they'd known each other for years. Us men just sat, murmuring between sips of roobois and hoping the enforced silence would make things less awkward. 

Then the chanting began. I wish someone had warned me about the chanting. Every meditation begins with Goenka reciting Buddhist scripture in a long, low, loud, crumbly drone that fails to adhere to any standards of tonality. Musically, it is very, very bad. However, I soon came to appreciate the chanting, finding it soothing and helpful for meditation (it took a couple days). The resonant sound fills the room and provides a good atmosphere for relaxation while the exotic otherworldliness really makes you feel like you doing something ancient and eminently spiritual. 

I went to bed that first night not sure what to think. I had survived an evening of sitting still, but I certainly didn't feel any different. Little did I know that the next ten days would be a fucking roller-coaster ride of emotions.

### Life on Retreat 

The first day was simple, slow, and boring. We began with breath meditation and I spent the entire day trying to focus on my nostrils. My mind was scattered and the meditation never seemed to go anywhere. Time dragged by agonizingly slowly, but I was impressed by the quality of the food and how good all the other students were at avoiding eye contact. 

I awoke the next morning acutely aware of the fact that I had to spend nine more days in this purgatory. I slept through the morning meditation period, preferring the entertainment of my dreams to the tedium of the cushion. Eventually, I reminded myself why I was there and dragged myself back to meditation. My mind appeared to be just as scattered the day before; however, by that evening I began to feel the first inkling of a deep sense of calm. 

A great source of distraction that I grappled with during these first few days was dreaming. In the absence of any stimulation during the day, I noticed that my dream recall was vastly improved. Thus, my dreams became the most action-packed part of my day; I got to see friends, fight giant spiders, and fly around like a demi-god. I started napping as much as possible until I discovered this strategy's significant downsides: grumpiness and grogginess. 

On the third day, a floodgate opened up in my psyche. I had been battling distraction since I showed up, but now the thoughts which clamored for my attention became harsh, vivid and personal. Trying to focus on the breath felt like trying to conn a ship in a hurricane. Memories rushed to the surface, beginning with recent events and progressing backwards in time until visions of childhood toys that I had not thought about for years began spontaneously arising.

At times, the inability to control my own my mind made me incredibly anxious. As my internal dialogue fragmented and voices in my head began berating me, the discomfort in my knees and back from maintaining proper posture became searing pain. I could see how mental and physical discomfort amplify each other. During these stressful moments, I observed that the contents of my spontaneously arising thoughts became very predictable. Thoughts about sex and, of all things, video games would race through my mind. I cam to understand that my mind was grasping for familiar sources of escape and sensual gratification in order to escape the discomfort of the present moment. 

Despite how disturbing and uncontrollable these episodes were, they always came to an end. Often, I would sit through bouts of mental anguish, bombarded by horrifyingly graphic sexual imagery, only to end the meditation session in a blissful calm. During one sitting, I remember having the distinct sensation that snow was falling in the hall, covering everything in a soft, warm, blanket of silence. I came to love the routine of slipping into the stillness of meditation, greeting the lunch bell with gratitude, and walking through the hall with a pleasant, acute awareness of my body. 

After four days of practicing meditation on the breath, I began to feel very comfortable with the rhythm of the retreat. I was having meals and going for walk-abouts in a meditative calm. I felt like I was getting the hang of it.

However, this was soon shattered by the introduction of the Vipassana meditation technique. The Vipassana technique as taught by Goenka involves proceduraly passing one's attention through the body, starting with focusing on the “top of the head” and moving down to the “tips of the toes.” At the end of the introductory two-hour meditation, I felt wrenched out of my body, curiously aware that I was observing the actions of a clunky, fleshy body from a precarious position somewhere outside of it. 

This style of meditation felt more cognitively demanding than breath meditiation. On top of trying to maintain concentration, now I was struggling to locate subtle sensations on my shoulders and armpits. We were also told to begin the practice of sitting Adhiṭṭhāna, without moving.

Fortunately, an experience I had with another meditator provided an interesting lesson in equanimity. At the beginning of the second half of the course, an elderly gentleman who normally sat several spaces in front of me moved to a chair directly behind me. Something must have made him sick because around this time he also adopted a habit of coughing, yawning, and sniffling during our sittings. So there I was, attempting to sit through pain Adhiṭṭhāna-style with this guy's mouth less than four feet away from my head, the sound of his epiglottis flapping around was channelled directly into my ear. At first, I was annoyed. Then, a hatred developed withing me that sparked a state of panicked rage everytime he made a sound. I felt ashamed about my aversion, but how could he do this to me? Didn't he have any respect? Trying to ignore the sounds didn't work. I couldn't be equanimous. Eventually, I could feel my body tensing up with amygdala-flavored stress before the sounds even had the opportunity to consciously register in my mind.

I had a breakthrough when I stopped trying to ignore the sound and instead consciously reacted to it with empathy and compassion. Once I was able to replace the anger with love just once, I noticed the effect snowball until it become unconscious. Although there was some backsliding along the way, by unpairing the sound with feelings of enger, I eventually ended up rewiring my response to be positive rather than negative.

### Meditation and the Brain 

Throughout all of this, I was intensely curious about what this meditation was doing to my brain. Goenka's nightly talks explained that we were learning to control our minds and cultivate non-attachment and selflessness. I was becoming more comfortable with these ideas, but the scientist within me wanted to go deeper. 

Scientific research on meditation has exploded in the last couple years, but the field is still filled with contention and murkiness (see [this awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA) for a glimpse of how complex the cognitive neuroscience of meditation has become). In order to avoid getting too academic or too inaccurate, I'll only discuss some of the key neuroscientific findings that relate to my experience on retreat (for an in-depth review on what is known, see Vago and Silbersweig 2012).

Thanks to neuroimaging, there is now growing body of evidence linking meditation to physical changes in the brain such as increased cortical volume (Lazar et al. 2005), white matter connectivity (Tang et al. 2012), and cortical gyrification (Luders et al. 2012). Furthermore, other research has described the benefits of meditation on domains such as attention (Hodgins and Adair 2010) and mood (Khoury et al. 2013). The story that the research describes is this: meditation activates brain regions underlying abilities like concentration and emotional regulation and, over time, strengthens these abilities through experience dependent neuroplasticity. 

There are three basic types of meditation taught within Buddhism and each techniqued has been studied more less independently and shown to induce a specific pattern of activation in the brain, which leads to specific benefits of long-term practice. On the retreat, I was impressed to discover that these different forms of meditation lead to vastly different subjective experiences and qualities of mind that stayed with me once I left the cushion.

Anapana or breath meditation, where one focuses intensely on the breath, is a classic form of concentration meditation that has been shown to recruit the attentional subprocesses of alerting, orienting, and executive control, each of which appears to be mediated by a different region of the brain (Manna et al. 2010; Raz and Buhle 2006). Meditating on my breath for hours at a time, I swear I could almost see my attention deconstructed into these different subsystems.

As the retreat progressed, I noticed a significant improvement in my ability to direct my attention. I was able to go for walks and eat meals without losing track of the breath. I witnessed an entire sunset without getting distracted or bored. Indeed. enhanced attentional control has been demonstrated in experienced meditators, who perform better on the famous [Stroop Test](http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/java/ready.html) (5,9)

Strengthening these attentional subsystems may be beneficial for reasons beyond increasing the ability to focus. For example, activity in the attention network has also shown that activity in the brain networks that underlie focused awareness, inhibit activity in the brain's default network (Fox et al. 2005). The default network is thought to be involved in day-dreaming and self-referential thinking (ie. "I should have applied for that internship," "That coffee made me tired", "I'm not the type of guy she's in to"). Over-activity in this network is thought to underlie the ruminative bummer thoughts that are a core feature of depression (Smallwood and O’Connor 2011). The relationship between meditation and decreased activity in this netwok is one of the most compelling explanations for how it may increase well-being (Brewer et al. 2011). Furthermore, cultivating the ability to be aware of one's own attention may be helpful in disentangling environmental triggers from habitual behaviour patterns, such as I was able to do with the old guy's yawns (Hodgins and Adair 2010). 

However, concentration meditation in the Vipassana tradition is only seen as a stepping stone. The real meat of the retreat is the Vipassana body-scanning technique that is taught as a way to develop panna, wisdom born of self-awareness and equanimity. Panna may be manifested in the increased well-being and resistance to stress seen in long-term meditators (Brown and Ryan 2003; Mohan et al., Bijlani 2011). 

What sprang to my mind while I was painstakingly performing the body scans (besides how cool it would be to image my somatosensory cortex activity), was what I read about the effect of long-term meditation on grey matter density in the insula (Hölzel et al. 2008). The insula is an interesting  region of the cerebral cortex that lies deep in the brain and has connections to the frontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, and mid-brain regions involved in mood. The interesting thing about the insula is that it is organized such that its posterior regions regulate awareness of low-level phenomena like heartbeat and bodily sensations, while its anterior portion is involved in awareness of higher-level phenomena such as emotions and motivational states (Critchley et al. 2004). It's possible that the insula could be where body sensations integrate with subjective feeling states, mediating a bidirectional interaction between somatic sensations and emotions. Basically, the insula may control how the world makes us feel.

If multiple forms of self-awareness are processed in the same place, it may mean that simply observing body sensations will lead to improvements in the awareness and regulation of other internal phenomenon. Perhaps due to shared neural circuitry in the insula or the spill-over effects of a local growth stimulus, there might be a physiological basis for the efficacy of body meditation to improve  one's ability to control how they respond to the stresses and discomforts of the world.


The final type of meditation taught on the retreat is metta, or loving-kindness meditation. The practice involves arousing and broadcasting kindness and has been shown to increase activity in mood and empathy-related areas (Lutz et al. 2008). In my experience, the practice almost always leads to tremor-inducing feelings of warmth and compassion. Interestingly, long-term loving-kindness practice is associated with larger cortical volume at the tempoparietal junction, the area of the brain shown to be crucial for theory of mind and social cognition (Holzel et al. 2011; Sowden and Catmur 2013). 

The current state of research suggests a story: frequent activation of brain regions during meditation increases the volume of these areas and improves their function. In this way, the brain could be expected to function much like a muscle. In order to see functional improvements in attention, self-control, and mood, one woud need to perform continous, challenging exercise. Furthermore, in order to maintain these improvements, the exercise needs to be maintained. 

At the risk of sounding like a "scientific materialistic," I would suggest that the meditation I did on retreat was essentially a workout for a handful of different brain networks. By focusing on my breath, I strengthened my attentional networks. By scanning my body, I strengthened my insula's capacity for self-regulation, and by practicing loving-kindness, I exercised the regions of my brain responsible for feeling compassion. Although this a gross over-simplification, meditation did wasn't much different than going to the gym to work out my muscles. Like muscles, I believe that these networks require consistent, challenging exercise in order to become stronger, and furthermore, that they require continual training in order to maintain the benefits.

### Vipassana in Life

When I arrived back in the real world, I felt incredibly peaceful, disciplined, and content. Observing the business of the city, I felt a little bit of a child-like wonder.  My laptop felt like some kind of cryptic object, I loved that. Many of the retreat's benefits withered in the weeks following the retreat, as I stopped making time to meditate and became reacquainted with stress, over-stimulation, and booze. Absolutely, I believe that the benefits of meditation are “dose-dependent.” Since I have settled down and returned to my practice, I've noticed inklings of that deep peace coming back to me. My meditations go deeper and faster than they ever did before the retreat. I guess it's like a riding a bike.

If you are considering attending a retreat, I encourage you to go. Some parts of it will be really fucking hard in a way you may have never experienced in your life. However, it'll all be balanced out by the positive, such is life. You'll learn more about yourself in the process and come out feeling vastly different than you did going in. It will be a rich experience.

I am considering going back for another round when the timing works out. A retreat once a year seems to be a good opportunity to clear your headspace and make sure you're headed down the right track. Besides, it was a lot of [fun](http://kellycordes.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/the-fun-scale/).

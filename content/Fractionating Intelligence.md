Title: Fractionating Human Intelligence
Summary: A friend of mine recently drew my attention to [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312005843) regarding the neural systems of general intelligence. Besides reminding me of my only time attempting to measure my IQ (taking the long-invalidated Tickle.com test at 13 years old while my mom yelled at me from the kitchen), this formidable piece of science had me thinking about how difficult it really is to quantify something as complex, plastic, and context-dependent as intelligence.

A friend of mine recently drew my attention to [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312005843) regarding the neural systems of general intelligence. Besides reminding me of my only time attempting to measure my IQ (taking the long-invalidated Tickle.com test at 13 years old while my mom yelled at me from the kitchen), this formidable piece of science had me thinking about how difficult it really is to quantify something as complex, plastic, and context-dependent as intelligence.

Unsurprisingly, the classic theory of IQ is getting a little outdated. Psychologists in the early twentieth century developed the idea of a generalized factor of intelligence based on the finding that performance was correlated across many different types of cognitive tasks. With the aid of fMRI and principal component analysis, [this interesting pape](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312005843) attempts to answer the question of whether IQ has a distinct neural correlate or is an artifact of the interaction between multiple specialized systems? 

Much of the paper goes into some pretty advanced statistical modelling that I won't be able to cover, but there were some general highlights that I found very interesting. 

* The areas of the brain that are activated during different cognitive tests can be divided into areas specifically related to working memory (WM) and reasoning
* Variability in IQ test scores can best be explained by modelling intelligence as the result of multiple factors (working memory, reasoning, verbal)
* There was a small positive association between working memory and reasoning performance and frequency of computer gaming
* individuals who suffered from anxiety had slightly lower working memory scores
* Differences between men and women on the cognitive tests were negligible
* Alcohol and caffeine consumption had a negligible effect on cognitive performance

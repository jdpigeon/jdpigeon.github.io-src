Title: When research doesn't seem to work out

Today I just got the results back from an experiment that was supposed to form the backbone of my thesis. It wasn't good.

The experiment involved the CLARITY technique, which is an advanced method of making organic tissue transparent and, which it turns out, is a son of a bitch to actually make work. The specifics aren't important, but basically, there's a lot of trouble-shooting that needs to be done and I am not allowed to do it because the technique can only be performed by one of the senior postdocs.

This brings up what seems to be a more universal problem in science, though. I am just starting up, but have seen some shit in my time. Projects fail all the time. It's just the nature of science -- poking at a bunch of different ideas with time and effort always turns out a couple dead ends. A real important skill to have then is to understand where your project is headed, how hopeful it is, and how to pivot away from it when things don't seem to be working. So, maybe good researcher has to be a lot like a good entrepreneur.

I'm stuck with the unfortunate prospect of trying to pivot a project that already sits at a pretty low position in the hierarchy of projects at the lab. I'm not personally distraught, but looking forward to the challenge. Even though it involves the end of something, it's going to mean change. And that's what I've been craving lately.

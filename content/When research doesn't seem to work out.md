Title: When research doesn't seem to work out
Summary: Today I just got the results back from an experiment. It wasn't good.

Today I just got the results back from an experiment that was supposed to form the backbone of my thesis. It wasn't good.

The experiment involved the CLARITY technique, which is an advanced method of making organic tissue transparent and, which it turns out, is a son of a bitch to actually make work. The specifics aren't important, but basically, there's a lot of trouble-shooting that needs to be done and I am not allowed to do it because the technique can only be performed by one of the senior postdocs.

This made me realize something about the nature of working in science. Projects fail all the time. If we're being honest with ourselves, poking complex biological systems with random ideas should always turn out more dead ends than positive results. Unfortunately, it's not possible to survive as a researcher earnestly spinning out null results. Thus, an important skill to have is to be able continually reexamine your project as it proceeds, keeping track of how likely it is to turn into something good, and how to pivot away from it if things stop working. In a way, maybe a good researcher has to be a lot like a good entrepreneur.

I'm stuck with the unfortunate prospect of trying to pivot a project that already sits at a pretty low position in the hierarchy of projects at the lab. I'm not personally distraught, but looking forward to the challenge. Even though it involves the end of something, it's going to mean change. And that's what I've been craving lately.

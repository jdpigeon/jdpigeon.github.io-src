    <p>One of the benefits of being a grad student is the opportunity to travel to other universities for the occasional workshop or retreat. This summer, in the twilight of my MSc., I was fortunate enough to get such an opportunity, a <a href="radiant.com">summer entrepreneurial fellowship </a> at Dalhousie University in Halifax. Awesome! A chance to get outside of the lab. Also, a great excuse for an outdoor trip. I took some time off after the fellowship to cycle the Cabot Trail and thought I'd share my experience in order to give some information to others thinking about making the trip themselves (which I heartily recommend!).</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Cabot trail is a 300km loop that winds around the northern part of Cape Breton, including the Highlands National Park and several small communities. The majority of the trail is a well-paved two-lane highway with only moderate traffic (mostly tourists in the Summer). The trail is unrelentingly hilly, especially in the park. Two mountain climbs (French Mt., North Mt.) present a significant uphill challenge that is best met with low gears and a firm resolve.</p>
<p>By reading several <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/13565"> trip</a> <a href="http://www.your-nova-scotia-holiday.com/cycling-the-cabot-trail.html">reports</a> posted around the web, I decided to tackle the trail in the clockwise direction. Supposedly, this ensures more favourable wind conditions, but I can't say I benefitted in any particular way from the wind; it seemed to be against me as often as with me. </p>
<p>I kept my riding distances under 80km per day and set a flexible schedule. In order to give some kind of order to my trip, I <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838">downloaded the Google Map</a> of the entire area and marked the locations of all the campgrounds and restaurants I thought I might want to visit. Didn't need a physical map. This all worked out really well, though of course I didn't get to every thing I had marked. I made it around the trail in 6 days, sore and satisfied when it was over, but could see the trip could be shortened to just 3 days.</p>

<h2>Day One: Halifax to Margaree</h2>
<p>It's worth mentioning how the trip officially began in Halifax -- grabbing shuttle bus from Halifax. I went with the <a href="http://www.scotiashuttle.ca/">Scotia Shuttle</a> company. I'd recommend them if you're looking for a way to get a bike up to Cape Breton. They were friendly, punctual, affordable, and best of all, able to fit my bike and all my gear in the back of their van.</p>

<p>The shuttle took around three hours, placing me in Baddeck at noon. I immediately found my way to <a href="http://visitbaddeck.com/bean-there-cafe/">Bean There Cafe</a>, where I caught up on a missed breakfast, double-checked my maps, and gathered courage (read: coffee). The forecast at the time predicted a thunderstorm touching down around six, so I, like a responsible adult, called ahead and reserve at a campground I knew I could reach before then.</p>

<p>Although most people start and end the Cabot Trail in Baddeck, the trail's two entrance points are actually a little bit outside of town. In order to get to the beginning of the trail heading clockwise, you have to head out from Baddeck on Margaree road. Maybe 2km in, Margaree becomes a dirt road (it's gorgeous, though). And here, surrounded by wild shrubbery and getting a feel for my bike's laden heft, I realized that the forecast I had seen earlier was definitely exactly 6 hours off. First there was drizzle, then, as I got to the <em>fun</em> part -- climbing up the Hunter Mt. -- a straight-up downpour. I cursed and shouted as I rode, terribly alone. It was just me and a bunch of wet plants. I cranked up the dharma talk in my headphones and by the time I started descending the mountain I was completely soaked and enjoying myself tremendously. My drenched t shirt lashed at my sides as I bombed the mountain. I felt free.</p>

<p>In this drenched, blissed-out state, arriving at the <a href="thelakesresort.com">Lakes Campground</a>, where I had planned to wait out the storm, was bittersweet. I was soaked beyond care and could have kept riding, but I <em>was</em> pretty hungry. I walked through the entrance sheepishly, summoning puddles. Fortunately, the Lakes' caretakers were incredibly friendly and accomodating. They let me dry off in the restaurant, served me up a "Big Boy" bacon cheeseburger, and even threw some of my wet clothes into the dryer downstairs.</p>

<h2>Day Two: Margaree to Corny Creek</h2>
<p>After a quick walk around the campground's premises, I set off again around 9:30. It was still drizzling and overcast, but the stretch of riding I did this morning wound up being one of my favorites. Between Middle River and Margaree (the town), the land opens up the north of the trail, revealing gently rolling farmland and green, mist-wreathed mountains, like what I imagine Ireland looks like. I picked up on a sense of something ancient and magical here and my thoughts drifted  back the Tolkien-inspired fantasy headspace of my childhood. The pleasantness of this morning was also enhanced by a quick break to gather courage at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DancingGoatCafe/">Dancing Goat Cafe</a>, where I ran into an infectiously happy, giddy group of retirees.</p>

<p>Then the ocean appeared, making its presence felt with prickly buffets. The level of moisture in the air picked up and a fierce wind blew from the west. Cycling in this started feeling pretty heroic. A windward bluff provided shelter for lunch -- two instant ramen packets  -- and gave me a chance to glimpse the ocean churning from on high. </p>

<p>I settled into a groove on the way to Cheticamp. The rugged coastline provided incredible scenery, as did the numerous quaint, Acadian homes dotting the landscape. Every one who lives around here seems to be named Aucoin or LeBlanc...</p>

<p>In Cheticamp, I visited a grocery store (big Co-op on the trail, can't miss out) to pick up food and eavesdrop on the local's mixed conversations. I swear I could hardly understand a word of their French. What an accent, yeesh.</p>

<p>The stretch between Cheticamp and the Highlands park was idyllic. The trail rolls through pleasant rural properties and over a river, similar to a lot of other charming places on the trail.</p>

<p>When I got to the Highlands Nation Park I knew I was in for a treat. Here, the land becomes mountainous with enormous, exposed cliffs rising up out of the sea. I'd go so far as to say it's the East Coast's compelling competitor to Big Sur.</p>

<p>To make the most of the day, I headed down to a beach just after 'La Grande Failaise'. Totally beautiful, this beach, in the fading daylight. There are two rock monoliths to the south end of a mixed rock and a classically sandy beach. I found a perch on a little bluff and settled in for a pre-dinner snack as I watched the tourists spill in. There was a particular sense of superiority I enjoyed as a bike tourist, watching the bovine, selfie-stick-toting throng spill out of their rented luxury SUVs. </p>

<div style='margin-top: 2cm; margin-bottom: 2cm'>
<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:57%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/FrankCriminalBlueshark' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>


<p>After the beach, I packed up my bike and continued to the Corney Brook campsite. Luckily, I was able to grab the last open site here and treat myself to an extra large macaroni and cheese dinner: elbows, Edam cheese, garlic butter, classic camping food.</p>

<h2>Day Three: Over French Mt. to Pleasant Bay</h2>
<p>On the third day I tackled French Mt., the highest point on the Cabot Trail. No easy feat, but coming from South it was more of just a really long slog as opposed to being unpleasantly steep. My <a href="http://allcitycycles.com/bikes/space_horse">Space Horse</a> nailed the climb. Halfway up, I was passed by a spritely, athletic-looking, tanned group of seniors on road bikes. One of them took a break with me (for cameraderie or pity I do not know) and offered me a delicious Israeli energy bar.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="Halfway up French Mt." src="images/frenchmt.jpg" width = 100% align = "center"/>

</figure>

<p>At the summit of French Mt., I decided to hike the Skyline trail, without a doubt the park's most popular trail. Tons of people on it. The trail's nice -- cool views of wind-swept peaks at the end and a few km of an ecologically interesting grassland (the result of a 1970s bug infestation) slowly being reclaimed by trees. This apparently provides the perfect environment for moose, which makes sense cause I saw one! Right up close! Holy shit.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="A bull moose grazing on saplings" src="images/moose.jpg" width = 100% />
<figcaption>A bull moose grazing on saplings</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After checking out the Skyline, I went on to visit "the Bog" and Benji's Lake. Both were great, especially so because of the incredible variety of unusual plants. The young deer ferns that lined the Benji's Lake trail  were so soft and such an alluring shade of green that I wished I was a moose, capable of grazing. Also really cool were the carnivorous sundew plants (<em>Drosera rotundifolia</em>) in the Bog and along the edge of the Lake.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="A sundew" src="images/sundew.jpg" width = 100% />
<figcaption>A sundew. They trap flies with little globs of glue secreted by their leaves!</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Continuing down the trail (man, it is so fun to bike around the top of this mountain!), I eventually ran into some construction, which was holding up traffic for a little while. This forced me into a social encounter with two other cyclists on the trail: Zoe and Jeshi. I felt like a cycling amateur when I learned where they'd come from. Jeshi had ridden all the way from Maine and Zoe had started cycling in Vancouver(!) and was days away from ending her cross-Canada road trip in St. John's. They both had that serene come-what-may attitude of people who've been on the road a long time</p>
<figure>
<img alt="So much fun to bike around up here" src="images/mtroad.jpg" width = 100% />

</figure>


<p>The descent down French Mt. was a basket of anxiety. The road zig zags back and forth quite a bit, so one has to lay on the brakes at nearly every moment to avoid careening into the guard rail at high speed. There were ecstatic moments, but it was mostly a white knuckle brakefest.</p>

<p>For dinner that day I visited the Rusty Anchor. It's quite the tourist feature, but I figured I might as well splurge for the experience. 50/50 Lobster/Crab Roll. Fantastic Dish. The lobster was better than the crab, of course.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>50/50 roll at Rusty Anchor. The Lobster was excellent.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I spent this night at the MacIntosh Brook campground, which was absolutely lovely. There's a wide open grass field next to a stream and even a cabin with a stove, water, and electricity to charge the gadgets. I happened into Zoe and Jeshi here, as well as two other bike tourists from Montreal. We spent the evening hanging out, trading stories and discussing MSc. thesis projects until we turned in for bed at geriatric 9:30pm.</p>


<h2>Day Four: MacIntosh Creek to Ingonish Beach</h2>
<p>After a communal coffee-filled morning in which I shared the francophones my <a href="http://campingwithgus.com/2011/10/16/cowboy-coffee/">cowboy coffee technique</a> we all set off to tackle North Mt. This one was wicked -- shorter, but much steeper than French. Plus, there was little shade and temperatures that climbed to nearly thirty degrees. A lot of breaks, spin class-level exertion, and hollering got me to the top, eventually. Topping out was momentous. My sweat cooled in the wind during the downhill stretches after the peak, which were fucking <em>great.</em></p>

<figure>
<img alt="Jeshi on the downhill after the peak of North Mt." src="images/jeshi.jpg" width = 100% />
<figcaption>Jeshi on the downhill after the peak of North Mt.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After a long run-out from North Mt., I stopped to grab a cone at little art and ice cream store. There's advertisements for <a href="https://scotsburn.com/">Scotsburn</a>, some kind of Maritime ice cream brand everywhere. I had to try some. Being hungry and exhausted certainly must have had to something to do with how transcendent this experience was. Consuming a cone of chocolate ice cream in a field, I became one with the murmur of the crickets, the peeling paint of the gift shop, and the heat of the sun, everything in its right place.</p>

<p>Not long after the ice cream stop, I ran into Zoe and Jeshi again (hard to keep eager, distractable cycle tourists together it turns out) at a general store in Cape North. I stopped with them and had a lunch of fried clams (not too impressive; they didn't taste like much besides "deep fried"). I got the sense this place was a real fixture of the community. The food was cheap and it was packed. A local lady with a dog recommended the breakfast sandwiches.</p>

<p>My next stop was the Chowderhouse in Neil's Harbour. As a fan of chowder, I was looking forward to it when planning my trip. However, I found it packed full of tourists when I arrived around 2pm and didn't have that much of an appetite due to the ice cream and clams (who would have guessed?). I used the bathroom and nipped out. Neil's Harbour had a really nice lighthouse, despite it being overcast. I find there's just something really depressing about the beach when it's overcast </p>

<figure><img alt="The lighthouse in Neil's Harbour. It was overcast when I was there. I find there's just something really depressing about the beach when it's overcast" src="images/lighthouse.jpg" width = 100%/>
<figcaption>Lighthouse at Neil's Harbour.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>I found the next stretch, between Neil's Harbour and Ingonish, especially difficult. This was my most grueling day and the wear and tear of cycling had started to set in a little bit -- a touch of tendonitis in the achilles and a slight resurgence of patellofemoral in my right knee pain. Halfway up the last hill before Ingonish (unbeknowst to me at the time), I pulled over and sprawled beside the road, taking a much-needed rest. The concerned drivers who pulled over to check on me reassured me in the essential decency of humanity.  </p>

<p>Having skipped the Chowderhouse, I was planning on stopping at the Seagull restaurant to refuel. However, it was closed that day so I opted for the Coastal Waters Restaurant just down the way. It was a real "bar and grill" type place with beer artifacts on the walls and a little bit of a biker vibe. The fish and chips here were pretty damn good. Plus, they were playing <a href="unionduke.com">Union Duke</a> on the speakers (a local Toronto band), so I figure they're alright.  </p>

<p>To finish the night, I visited Ingonish Beach and made sure to bathe in both the ocean and the lake that was right next to it. This was extremely refreshing. Even if you're sore and limping around from being on the bike all day you can still swim. After my dip, I settled in for the night at the Ingonish Beach Campground. Note: Ingonish Beach has an entry booth that was manned until 10pm and a heavy ranger presence. Keep that in mind if you're used to being able to dirtbag your way in for free.  </p>


<h2>Day Five: Ingonish Beach to St. Anne's Bay</h2>
<p>I hustled out of the campground early to have breakfast somewhere a little bit more scenic. I settled on a ledge overlooking the ocean and prepped myself for more riding as groundskeepers for the Ingonish Beach golf course proceeded past me to their duties. Oatmeal with peanut butter and more cowboy coffee did the trick. I felt so perked up I decided to take a selfie. </p>

<figure>
<img alt="Feeling happy after four days of camping" src="images/selfie.jpg" style = "width: 50% !important" />
<figcaption>Feeling happy after four days of camping</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>The trail following Ingonish Beach winds around Ingonish Harbour, perhaps the most scenic area in the group of "Ingonish" locations. Google had made predictions of heavy rain later in the day, but the morning sky was clear and brilliant and I enjoyed the wetlands surrounding the harbor. In one of the neighborhoods surrounding the harbor I came across a blueberry stand and picked up some jam that became a huge hit when I combined it with the peanut butter, apple, and raisin bread sandwiches I had been routinely consuming.  </p>

<p>I knew there was one more big hill I to overcome -- Cape Smokey -- so I quickly caffeinated with another cup of coffee at the Knotty Pine Cottages general store, where I hit upon the news that a church a bit further down the road on St. Anne's Bay would host a <em>Ceilidh</em> that night. I'd heard about these things (pronounce <em>Kay-lease</em>) from multiple sources and wanted to check one out. Apparently, they're traditional gaelic musical gatherings.  </p>

<p>Cape Smoke's climb turned out to be no problem. Maybe I got stronger. However, I was surprised by how awesome the descent was. Unlike the previous two mountains, the road does not zig zag back and forth the whole way. Instead, there's a cpp; mixture of tight and broad turns, with more space to safely gain speed. There's even a S-curve near the end that you can take pretty fast. When I got to the bottom, I almost contemplated going back up to bomb it again. It was that fun.  </p>

<figure>
<img alt="Top of Cape Smokey. Killer downhill after this" src="images/smokey.jpg" width = 100% align = "center"/>

</figure>

<p>After Cape Smokey, I hit up the Dancing Moose Cafe for lunch. I hadn't been planning on visiting this spot, but the caretaker at Knotty Pine had specifically recommended their bacon-baked-inside pannekoken. Intriguing. Bacon Apple Raisin pannekoken ended up exceeding all my expectations. So good, I hung out for a few hours and also tried their lobster chowder -- incredible. Creamy. </p>

<p>The young guy waiting tables at the Moose (obviously the owners' kid) told me about a beach I could visit a few km down the road, a place where there was also a wharf for professional lobster fisherman. I couldn't miss the opportunity to see a real maritime crustacean operation, so I headed down to the Little River Wharf after lunch. I didn't hang around too long (it was overcast), but I did see several guys pull up in trucks and fuss with boats that were anchored at the wharf. Lobster carcasses were littered around in unusual places.  </p>

<p>Not too long after the Wharf, right in Indian Brook, more construction began. This time it was a bit of a bummer as there was a long stretch of grooved road that wasn't the most pleasant to ride over. I rode on, doing my best to dodge the multitudes of caterpillars inching their way across the highway.</p>

<p>Despite my best efforts to kill time at the Moose, I arrived at St. Ann's Bay United Church (where the <em>Ceilidh</em> was due to take place), several hours early. After another round of sandwiches and coffee, I did what I thought was best -- take a nap in the forest. I hiked a bit down the Red Island Trial located next to the church and settled down with my sleeping pad as a pillow. I was woken once by a red(?) squirrel screaming from a few meters behind me and once by a group of kindly old ladies passing through the trail I was reclined out next to.  </p>

<p>As soon as the <em>Ceilidh</em> started, I knew I was in for something special. First off, there was almost no one anywhere close to my age. Besides a few kids, everyone appeared to be over the age of 65, and it was clear everyone knew each other. The musicians that were playing were a local Cape Breton family -- husband, wife, and daughter and, as it turned out, the audience happened to be filled with members of their extended family. I saw enough hugs, kisses, and love-filled glances that I started thinking fondly on my own mom. I stepped outside only to realize that I was out of range of cellphone reception.  </p>

<p>Here was a real Cape Breton community assembled over music, singing songs about the area where they lived and the lives of their ancestors. There was nothing staged about this. It had the character of a jam session breaking out at a family reunion. The palpable sense of community generated by a bunch of relatives still living in a tight-knit way made me think about what our generation, with its diaspora -- ubiquitous plans to move away from home and study or find a career -- is giving up. </p>

<div style='margin-top: 2cm; margin-bottom: 2cm'>
<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:57%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ZestyLoneBirdofparadise' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

<p>After the show, I was warm and content enough to settle down anywhere for the night. I chose a spot in the woods near the trail where I had napped earlier. No campground needed, just a soft, loamy spot in the woods. I had a night of deep, peaceful sleep with colorful, thoughtful dreams, the best I had on the whole trip.  </p>


<p>The realization that I had scant amount of time left in Cape Breton was counterbalanced by the beauty of my surroundings when I woke up this last morning. It's very comfortable to wake up completely by oneself, far away from the activity of others. I took a hike down to the end of the trail as the sun rose above the trees, noting the many varieties of mushrooms that sprang out of the earth.  </p>

<figure>
<img alt="The scene around my campsite in the morning" src="images/forestmorning.jpg" width = 100% />

</figure>

<p>With the words of the musicians I met at the <em>Celidh</em> last night in my head, I made sure to soak up as much nature as I could. When I passed the beautiful North River, a few km down the road, this meant stripping off my clothes and plunging in for a late-morning bath.

<div style='margin-top: 2cm; margin-bottom: 2cm'>
<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:57%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/MatureRemoteCopepod' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

<p>There's always a hesitation in the mind about committing to cold water and, though I pride myself on being the type of person who is good at overcoming this, I always battle with the old familiar fear. The scene was so inviting that there really was no question about it this time. Plus, the North River is the last proper river crossing along the trail before Baddeck. Of course, all my hesitation was proved to be folly as soon as I got in the water. All remaining traces of my morning groggines were washed away and I felt better than ever.  </p>


<p>This inland road, the last stretch of the Cabot Trail that winds along the inner part of St. Anne's Harbour was certainly one of the highlights of the trail for a cyclist. The Highlands are visible to the North, but gone are the steep hills. Here, there's only a gentle, manageable peaks and dips, so one can really gain some consistent speed on the bike. This area is also noticeably less populated than the other areas of the trail; no ice cream stores and art gallerys, just small, quaint, retirement homes. </p>

<p>To get back to Baddeck at this point, you have to take highway 105 for a while. This is a bit of drag as it's nothing more than biking on the shoulder of a multi-lane highway, with cars and trucks passing you at the 90-110km/h speed range. However, once you get on route 205 back to Baddeck, there is a welcome return to picturesqueity. Winding along the edge of the Bras D'Or Lakes(s?), I ran into some classic maritime scenery here: sailboats, lightouses, reeds, diving birds, and flower gardens. At this point, I was really keen to settling into a cycling groove, relax, and soak it all in.  </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Eventually, I made it back to downtown Baddeck and the familiar old Bean There Cafe. A celebratory coffee and social media binge then, I was back on the highway en route to my real end destination -- the Big Spruce Brewing Company. Their brewery, taproom, and hopyard is just 15km down the highway from Baddeck. I had had their beer at the Stubborn Goat in Halifax and was honestly a bit blown away -- I didn't foresee such good beer coming from such a remote place. At some point along the trail I developed the idea that a few pints of IPA would be the perfect end to my odyssey. And it was! Their HQ was just what I was hoping for: a spacious, outdoor patio with which to enjoy the 6 different beers they had fresh on tap and I relished the chance to nerd out about beer again. I talked at length with an local couple about the area and got to know the bartender a little bit, who'd moved away from Cape Breton as a girl only be able to fully appreciate when she moved back as an adult. All of them were more than happy to listen to my enthusiastic, effusive rambling about my trip. I picked up a growler of their sour IPA (stellar, like magical fruit elixir) to take home. </p>

<p>Alas, things must come to an end and after only a precious two hours at the brewery I was back in the shuttle on my to Halifax again. Now, sitting in the train on my way back to Toronto, I write up my experience so that others may enjoy it.</p>

    <p>This summer I was fortunate enough to be invited for a <a href="radiant.com">summer fellowship</a> at Dalhousie University. What a great excuse for an outdoor trip! I took the invitation not only as a chance to learn more about life sciences entrepreneurship, but also to explore Nova Scotia itself, an area that I hadly scarcely ever imagined myself visiting in the past. Now that my journey is complete, I'd like to share my experience biking around the Cabot Trail, in order that I might help others who are thinking about making the trip themselves (I heartily recommend it, by the way!).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

</figure>
<p>The Cabot trail is an 300km loop that winds around the northern part of Cape Breton, including Cape Breton Highlands National Park and several small communities. The majority of the trail is a well-paved two-lane highway with only moderate traffic (mostly tourists in the Summer). However, the trail is very hilly, especially in the highlands. There are three sections (French Mt., North Mt., and Cape Smokey) that present a significant uphill challenge requiring low gears and a firm resolve.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/13565"> trip</a> <a href="http://www.your-nova-scotia-holiday.com/cycling-the-cabot-trail.html">reports</a> posted around the web, I decided to tackle the trail in the clockwise direction. This supposedly brings more favourable wind conditions, but I can't say I benefitted in any particular way from the wind. It seemed to blow against me just as often as it blew with me. </p>
<p>I kept my riding distances under 80km per day and had a very flexible schedule. In order to give some kind of order to my trip, I <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838">downloaded the Google Map</a> of the entire area and marked the locations of all the campgrounds and restaurants I thought I might want to visit. This all worked out really well. I didn't get to every place of interest, but I made it around the trail on time and felt pretty satisfied when it was over. though I see how the trip could be shortened to 3 days or stretched to 6 or longer.</p>

<h2>Day One: Halifax to Margaree</h2>
<p>I suppose my trip officially began in Halifax, where I was picked up by the <a href="http://www.scotiashuttle.ca/">Scotia Shuttle</a> company. I'd recommend them if you're looking for a way to get a bike up to Cape Breton. They were friendly, punctual, affordable, and best of all, able to fit my bike and all my gear in the back of their van.  </p>

<p>The shuttle took around 3 hours, placing me in Baddeck at noon. I immediately found my way to <a href="http://visitbaddeck.com/bean-there-cafe/">Bean There Cafe</a>, where I caught up on a missed breakfast, double-checked my maps, and gathered courage. The weather forecast at the time predicted a thunderstorm touching down around 6pm, so I, like a responsible adult, called ahead and reserve at a Campground I knew I could reach before then.</p>

<p>Although most people start and end the Cabot Trail in Baddeck, the trail's two entrance points are actually a little bit outside of town. In order to get to the beginning of the trail heading clockwise, I headed out from Baddeck on Margaree road. A couple minutes later, when Margaree became a dirt road, I realized that the forecast was about 6 hours off. First there was drizzle, then right as I got to the <em>fun</em> part -- climbing up Hunter Mt. -- a straight-up downpour. I cursed and shouted as I rode. After all, it was just me and a bunch of wet plants at that point. By the time I started descending the mountain, I was completely soaked and enjoying myself tremendously. My drenched t shirt lashed at my sides as I bombed the mountain. I felt free.  </p>

<p>In my drenched, blissed-out state, arriving at the <a href="thelakescampground.com">Lakes Campground</a>, where I had planned to wait out the storm, was bittersweet. I was soaked beyond care and could have kept riding, but I <em>was</em> pretty hungry. I walked through the entrance sheepishly, summoning puddles. Fortunately, the Lakes' caretakers were incredibly friendly and accomodating. They let me dry off in the restaurant, served me up a "Big Boy" bacon cheeseburger, and even threw some of my wet clothes into the dryer for me. </p>

<h2>Day Two: Margaree to Corny Creek</h2>
<p>After taking a quick walk around the campground's premises, I set off again around 9:30. It was still drizzling and overcast, but the stretch of riding I did this morning wound up being one of my favorites. The pleasantness of this morning was also enhanced by a quick trip to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DancingGoatCafe/">Dancing Goat Cafe</a>, where I ran into an infectiously happy group of old-timers.</p>

<p>Between Middle River and Margaree, the land opens up the north of the trail, revealing gently rolling farmland and green, mist-wreathed mountains, similar to what I imagine Ireland looks like. I picked up on a sense of something ancient and magical here and my thoughts drifted  back the Tolkien-inspired fantasy headspace of my childhood.</p>

<p>When the ocean finally appeared, it was sure to make its presence felt. The level of moisture in the air picked up dramatically and a fierce wind started blowing in from the west. The riding started feeling pretty heroic. I pulled behind a windward bluff to have lunch -- two instant ramen packets  -- and caught a glimpse of the ocean churning around the rocks below. </p>

<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:57%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WhimsicalDeepAsp' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>I settled into a good riding groove on the way to Cheticamp. The rugged coastline provided incredible scenery, as did the numerous quaint, Acadian homes dotting the landscape. Every one around here seemed to be named Aucoin or LeBlanc...   </p>

<p>In Cheticamp, I visited the Co-op grocery store to pick up food and eavesdrop on the local's mixed English and French conversations. I swear I could hardly understand a word of their French. What an accent, yeesh.</p>

<p>I thought the stretch between Cheticamp and the Highlands park was incredibly idyllic. Rolling through pleasant rural properties and clean, tranquil water features. I was due to experience a lot of this landscape on the trail.</p>

<p>When I got the Park proper, I knew I was in for a treat. Here, the land becomes mountainous with enormous, exposed cliffs rising up out of the sea. I'd go so far as to say it's the East Coast's compelling competitor to Big Sur. Biking through here as the clouds parted and the sun began to fall in the sky was a real treat.</p>

<p>To make the most of the day, I headed down to a beach just after 'La Grande Failaise'. It was beautiful in the fading daylight, with two rock monoliths to the south end of a mixed rock and sand beach. There was perch on a little bluff just above the beach that I settled in to for a pre-dinner snack as I watched the tourists spill in. There was a particular sense of superiority I enjoyed as a bike tourist, watching the bovine, selfie-stick-toting throng spill out of their rented luxury SUVs. </p>

<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:57%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/FrankCriminalBlueshark' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<p>After the beach, I packed up my bike and continued on to the Corney Brook campsite. Luckily, I was able to grab the last open site here and treat myself to an extra large macaroni and cheese dinner.  </p>

<h2>Day Three: Over French Mt. to Pleasant Bay</h2>
<p>The next day I tackled French Mt., the highest mountain on the Cabot Trail. I'll admit that it was no easy feat, but coming from South it was just long as opposed to being unpleasantly steep. I was suprised by how powerfully I was able to handle the hill. However, I was passed by a spritely group of seniors on road bikes. They saw that I looked tired and offered my a delicious Israeli energy bar, however, so it was worth it.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Halfway up French Mt." src="images/frenchmt.jpg" width = 100% align = "center"/>

</figure>


<p>When I got to the top, I decided to hike the Skyline trail, one of the park's most popular trails judging by how many people there were. The trail is very nice -- cool views of wind-swept bluffs at the end and a few km of an interesting grassland being reclaimed by trees (the result of a 1970s bug infestation). This apparently provides the perfect environment for moose, which makes sense cause I saw one! Right up close! Awesome.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="A bull moose grazing on saplings" src="images/moose.jpg" width = 100% />
<figcaption>A bull moose grazing on saplings</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After checking out the Skyline trail, I went on to visit "the Bog" and Benji's Lake. Both were incredible for their unusual variety of plants. Young ferns lined the Benji's Lake that were so soft and such an alluring shade of green I wished I was a moose so that I could enjoy them. Also really cool was the sundew plants (<em>Drosera rotundifolia</em>) that were so plentiful at the edge of Benji's Lake.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="A sundew" src="images/sundew.jpg" width = 100% />
<figcaption>A sundew. They trap flies with little globs of glue secreted by their leaves!</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Continuing down the trail (man, it is so fun to bike around the top of this mountain!), I eventually ran into some construction, which was holding up traffic for a little while. This caused me to catch up with two cyclists on the trail ahead of me: Zoe and Jeshi. Jeshi had ridden all the way from Maine and Zoe had ridden all the way from Vancouver(!) and was days away from ending her cross-Canada road trip in St. John's. I was significantly embarassed when I told them I had only started two days ago.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="So much fun to bike around up here" src="images/mtroad.jpg" width = 100% />

</figure>


<p>The descent down French Mt. was a basket of anxiety. The road zig zags back and forth quite a bit, so one has to lay on the brakes to avoid careening into the guard rail at high speed. Still, it had it's ecstatic moments.</p>

<p>For dinner that day I visited the Rusty Anchor. It's quite the tourist feature, but I figured I might as well splurge for the experience. I would definitely recommend the 50/50 Lobster/Crab Roll. Fantastic Dish. The lobster was better than the crab, of course.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>50/50 roll at Rusty Anchor. The Lobster was best.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I spent this night at the MacIntosh Brook campground, which was absolutely lovely. There's a wide open grass field next to a stream and even a cabin with a stove, water, and electricity to charge the gadgets. Zoe and Jeshi were here, as well as two other bike tourists from Montreal. We spent the evening trading stories and discussing MSc. theses until we turned in for bed at geriatric 9:30pm.</p>


<h2>Day Three: MacIntosh Creek to Ingonish Beach</h2>
<p>After a communal coffee-filled morning in which I shared my exquisite <a href="http://campingwithgus.com/2011/10/16/cowboy-coffee/">cowboy coffee technique</a> we all set off to tackle North Mt. This one was wicked -- shorter, but much steeper than French Mt. Plus, there was little shade and the temperature climbed to nearly thirty degrees. A lot of breaks and whoops got me to the top eventually, though. Momentous. The downhill stretches after the peak were <em>fucking</em> great.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="Jeshi on the downhill after the peak of North Mt." src="images/jeshi.jpg" width = 100% />
<figcaption>Jeshi on the downhill after the peak of North Mt.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>After a long run-out from North Mt., I stopped to grab an ice cream cone at a general store. There's advertisements for <a href="https://scotsburn.com/">Scotsburn</a>, a certain brand of Maritime ice cream, everywhere. I had to try some. Being hungry and exhausted certainly had something to do with how transcendent this experience was. Consuming a cone of chocolate ice cream in a field, I became one with the murmur of the crickets, the peeling paint of the gift shop, and the heat of the sun, everything in its right place.</p>

<p>Not long after the ice cream stop, I ran into Zoe and Jeshi again (hard to keep eager, distractable cycle tourists together it turns out) at a general store in Cape North. I stopped with them and had a lunch of fried clams (not too impressive; they didn't taste like much besides "deep fried"). I got the sense this place was a real fixture of the community. The food was cheap and it was packed. A local lady with a dog recommended the breakfast sandwiches.</p>

<p>My next stop was the Chowderhouse in Neil's Harbour. As a fan of chowder, I was looking forward to it when planning my trip. However, I found it packed full of tourists when I arrived around 2pm and didn't have that much of an appetite due to the ice cream and clams (who would have guessed?). I used the bathroom and nipped out. Neil's Harbour had a really nice lighthouse, despite it being overcast. I find there's just something really depressing about the beach when it's overcast </p>

<figure><img alt="The lighthouse in Neil's Harbour. It was overcast when I was there. I find there's just something really depressing about the beach when it's overcast" src="images/lighthouse.jpg" width = 100%/>
<figcaption>Lighthouse at Neil's Harbour.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>I found the next stretch, between Neil's Harbour and Ingonish, especially difficult. This was my most grueling day and the wear and tear of cycling had started to set in a little bit -- a touch of tendonitis in the achilles and a slight resurgence of patellofemoral in my right knee pain. Halfway up the last hill before Ingonish (unbeknowst to me at the time), I pulled over and sprawled beside the road, taking a much-needed rest. The concerned drivers who pulled over to check on me reassured me in the essential decency of humanity.  </p>

<p>Having skipped the Chowderhouse, I was planning on stopping at the Seagull restaurant to refuel. However, it was closed that day so I opted for the Coastal Waters Restaurant just down the way. It was a real "bar and grill" type place with beer artifacts on the walls and a little bit of a biker vibe. The fish and chips here were pretty damn good. Plus, they were playing <a href="unionduke.com">Union Duke</a> on the speakers (a local Toronto band), so I figure they're alright.  </p>

<p>To finish the night, I visited Ingonish Beach and made sure to bathe in both the ocean and the lake that was right next to it. This was extremely refreshing. Even if you're sore and limping around from being on the bike all day you can still swim. After my dip, I settled in for the night at the Ingonish Beach Campground. Note: Ingonish Beach has an entry booth that was manned until 10pm and a heavy ranger presence. Keep that in mind if you're used to being able to dirtbag your way in for free.  </p>


<h2>Day Four: Ingonish Beach to St. Anne's Bay</h2>
<p>I hustled out of the campground early to have breakfast somewhere a little bit more scenic. I settled on a ledge overlooking the ocean and prepped myself for more riding as groundskeepers for the Ingonish Beach golf course proceeded past me to their duties. Oatmeal with peanut butter and more cowboy coffee did the trick. I felt so perked up I decided to take a selfie. </p>

<figure>
<img alt="Feeling happy after four days of camping" src="images/selfie.jpg" style = "width: 50% !important" />
<figcaption>Feeling happy after four days of camping</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>The trail following Ingonish Beach winds around Ingonish Harbour, perhaps the most scenic area in the group of "Ingonish" locations. Google had made predictions of heavy rain later in the day, but the morning sky was clear and brilliant and I enjoyed the wetlands surrounding the harbor. In one of the neighborhoods surrounding the harbor I came across a blueberry stand and picked up some jam that became a huge hit when I combined it with the peanut butter, apple, and raisin bread sandwiches I had been routinely consuming.  </p>

<p>I knew there was one more big hill I to overcome -- Cape Smokey -- so I quickly caffeinated with another cup of coffee at the Knotty Pine Cottages general store, where I hit upon the news that a church a bit further down the road on St. Anne's Bay would host a <em>Ceilidh</em> that night. I'd heard about these things (pronounce <em>Kay-lease</em>) from multiple sources and wanted to check one out. Apparently, they're traditional gaelic musical gatherings.  </p>

<p>Cape Smoke's climb turned out to be no problem. Maybe I got stronger. However, I was surprised by how awesome the descent was. Unlike the previous two mountains, the road does not zig zag back and forth the whole way. Instead, there's a cpp; mixture of tight and broad turns, with more space to safely gain speed. There's even a S-curve near the end that you can take pretty fast. When I got to the bottom, I almost contemplated going back up to bomb it again. It was that fun.  </p>

<figure>
<img alt="Top of Cape Smokey. Killer downhill after this" src="images/smokey.jpg" width = 100% align = "center"/>
<figcaption>Top of Cape Smokey. Killer downhill after this</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After Cape Smokey, I hit up the Dancing Moose Cafe for lunch. I hadn't been planning on visiting this spot, but the caretaker at Knotty Pine had specifically recommended their bacon-baked-inside pannekoken. Intriguing. Bacon Apple Raisin pannekoken ended up exceeding all my expectations. So good, I hung out for a few hours and also tried their lobster chowder -- incredible. Creamy. </p>

<p>The young guy waiting tables at the Moose (obviously the owners' kid) told me about a beach I could visit a few km down the road, a place where there was also a wharf for professional lobster fisherman. I couldn't miss the opportunity to see a real maritime crustacean operation, so I headed down to the Little River Wharf after lunch. I didn't hang around too long (it was overcast), but I did see several guys pull up in trucks and fuss with boats that were anchored at the wharf. Lobster carcasses were littered around in unusual places.  </p>

<p>Not too long after the Wharf, right in Indian Brook, more construction began. This time it was a bit of a bummer as there was a long stretch of grooved road that wasn't the most pleasant to ride over. I rode on, doing my best to dodge the multitudes of caterpillars inching their way across the highway.</p>

<p>Despite my best efforts to kill time at the Moose, I arrived at St. Ann's Bay United Church (where the <em>Ceilidh</em> was due to take place), several hours early. After another round of sandwiches and coffee, I did what I thought was best -- take a nap in the forest. I hiked a bit down the Red Island Trial located next to the church and settled down with my sleeping pad as a pillow. I was woken once by a red(?) squirrel screaming from a few meters behind me and once by a group of kindly old ladies passing through the trail I was reclined out next to.  </p>

<p>As soon as the <em>Ceilidh</em> started, I knew I was in for something special. First off, there was almost no one anywhere close to my age. Besides a few kids, everyone appeared to be over the age of 65, and it was clear everyone knew each other. The musicians that were playing were a local Cape Breton family -- husband, wife, and daughter and, as it turned out, the audience happened to be filled with members of their extended family. I saw enough hugs, kisses, and love-filled glances that I started thinking fondly on my own mom. I stepped outside only to realize that I was out of range of cellphone reception.  </p>

<p>Here was a real Cape Breton community assembled over music, singing songs about the area where they lived and the lives of their ancestors. There was nothing staged about this. It had the character of a jam session breaking out at a family reunion. The palpable sense of community generated by a bunch of relatives still living in a tight-knit way made me think about what our generation, with its diaspora -- ubiquitous plans to move away from home and study or find a career -- is giving up. </p>

<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:57%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ZestyLoneBirdofparadise' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>After the show, I was warm and content enough to settle down anywhere for the night. I chose a spot in the woods near the trail where I had napped earlier. No campground needed, just a soft, loamy spot in the woods. I had a night of deep, peaceful sleep with colorful, thoughtful dreams, the best I had on the whole trip.  </p>


<h2>Day Five: Back to Baddeck and Big Spruce Brewing</h2>
<p>The realization that I had scant amount of time left in Cape Breton was counterbalanced by the beauty of my surroundings when I woke up this last morning. It's very comfortable to wake up completely by oneself, far away from the activity of others. I took a hike down to the end of the trail as the sun rose above the trees, noting the many varieties of mushrooms that sprang out of the earth.  </p>

<figure>
<img alt="The scene around my campsite in the morning" src="images/forestmorning.jpg" width = 100% />
<figcaption>The scene around my campsite in the morning</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With the words of the musicians I met at the <em>Celidh</em> last night in my head, I made sure to soak up as much nature as I could. When I passed the beautiful North River, a few km down the road, this meant stripping off my clothes and plunging in for a late-morning bath.

<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:57%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/MatureRemoteCopepod' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<p>There's always a hesitation in the mind about committing to cold water and, though I pride myself on being the type of person who is good at overcoming this, I always battle with the old familiar fear. The scene was so inviting that there really was no question about it this time. Plus, the North River is the last proper river crossing along the trail before Baddeck. Of course, all my hesitation was proved to be folly as soon as I got in the water. All remaining traces of my morning groggines were washed away and I felt better than ever.  </p>


<p>This inland road, the last stretch of the Cabot Trail that winds along the inner part of St. Anne's Harbour was certainly one of the highlights of the trail for a cyclist. The Highlands are visible to the North, but gone are the steep hills. Here, there's only a gentle, manageable peaks and dips, so one can really gain some consistent speed on the bike. This area is also noticeably less populated than the other areas of the trail; no ice cream stores and art gallerys, just small, quaint, retirement homes. </p>

<p>To get back to Baddeck at this point, you have to take highway 105 for a while. This is a bit of drag as it's nothing more than biking on the shoulder of a multi-lane highway, with cars and trucks passing you at the 90-110km/h speed range. However, once you get on route 205 back to Baddeck, there is a welcome return to picturesqueity. Winding along the edge of the Bras D'Or Lakes(s?), I ran into some classic maritime scenery here: sailboats, lightouses, reeds, diving birds, and flower gardens. At this point, I was really keen to settling into a cycling groove, relax, and soak it all in.  </p>
<figure>
<img alt="Absurdly picturesque maritime views near Baddeck" src="images/Baddeck.jpg" width = 100% />
<figcaption>Absurdly picturesque maritime views near Baddeck</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Eventually, I made it back to downtown Baddeck and the familiar old Bean There Cafe. A celebratory coffee and social media binge then, I was back on the highway en route to my real end destination -- the Big Spruce Brewing Company. Their brewery, taproom, and hopyard is just 15km down the highway from Baddeck. I had had their beer at the Stubborn Goat in Halifax and was honestly a bit blown away -- I didn't foresee such good beer coming from such a remote place. At some point along the trail I developed the idea that a few pints of IPA would be the perfect end to my odyssey. And it was! Their HQ was just what I was hoping for: a spacious, outdoor patio with which to enjoy the 6 different beers they had fresh on tap and I relished the chance to nerd out about beer again. I talked at length with an local couple about the area and got to know the bartender a little bit, who'd moved away from Cape Breton as a girl only be able to fully appreciate when she moved back as an adult. All of them were more than happy to listen to my enthusiastic, effusive rambling about my trip. I picked up a growler of their sour IPA (stellar, like magical fruit elixir) to take home. </p>

<p>Alas, things must come to an end and after only a precious two hours at the brewery I was back in the shuttle on my to Halifax again. Now, sitting in the train on my way back to Toronto, I write up my experience so that others may enjoy it.</p>

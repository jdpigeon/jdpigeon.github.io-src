Inattention in the physical universe

What a world we live in! And what a nightmare of distraction it can be.

For those of us who spend the majoriryy of our working lives at a computer, the fact that nearly a limitless variety of information and entertainment is just one browser tab awa makes for a completely  ineffective encvironment. It's hard to imagine a time in history where the potential for distraction has been great. Even though griping about inattentiveness and addiction to entertaiment has been a common thread in moral polemics through the ages [cite that article], this time we may actually be suffering.

Is the answer Buddhism? It really could be.

The web nowadays is designed for us to react to it. Think of the facebook notification sound or the lists of suggested content prepared for us on YouTube or Reddit. These systems have been so successful because of their ability to tap into the natural, untrained state of our brains as reactive machines.

Buddhism runs directly counter to this state of constant, mindless reactivity. When you get down to it, its very core purpose is to untangle and erase the habitual patterns of reactivity that shape our lives against our wishes.

There is simply no way that the internet oculd not be making this pattern worse. By creating an environment (which we spend a lot of time in) that is defined by unthinking clicking and reacting, our brains start to accept that as a normal mode of behaving. It's just not productive to deep, thoughtful work, though, which is why many of us, myself included, are having problems.

An (interesting article)[https://hbr.org/2009/06/how-to-teach-yourself-restrain.html] argues that inattention (or distraction) can be a good thing. The idea put forward is that by distracting ourselves on one thing, we allow ourselves to ignore something else. If that something else is a thing that we shouldn't be doing, then managing distraction effectively can help us exercise restraint.

I'm not sure if I'm entirely on board with this. After all, what if that thing you're trying to distract yourself with just isn't as attractive as the thing you are trying to avoid? Doesn't it then still require an element of willful concentration to stay focused on it?
